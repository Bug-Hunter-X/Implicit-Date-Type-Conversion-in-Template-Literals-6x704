# Implicit Date Type Conversion in Template Literals

This code demonstrates a potential issue with implicit type conversion of Date objects within TypeScript's template literals. The problem is that the output of the date string may vary depending on the JavaScript engine used.

## Bug

The `greet` function takes a person's name and a Date object as input, then returns a greeting string that includes the formatted date. However, the date formatting relies on implicit type conversion within the template literal.

The implicit conversion of the Date object to a string is not guaranteed to be consistent across different JavaScript engines or environments, potentially leading to unexpected output.

## Solution

The solution is to explicitly format the Date object using `toLocaleDateString()` to ensure that the date string is consistently formatted across environments.  This provides greater control and predictability over the date's presentation.
